# IEESEC Website

The public website of IEESEC, the Software Engineering student community of the Department of Information and Electronic Engineering at the International Hellenic University (IHU).

The site presents the community, its members and technical interests, and provides a bilingual application flow for prospective members.

## Live site

- Production: <https://ieesec-website.vercel.app>
- Greek: <https://ieesec-website.vercel.app/el>
- English: <https://ieesec-website.vercel.app/en>

## Technology

- Next.js 16 App Router and React 19
- TypeScript and Tailwind CSS 4
- `next-intl` with Greek and English routes
- Playwright for unit-style and browser tests
- Vercel hosting and a server-side Discord webhook for join applications

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9 or newer
- pnpm 11.19.0
- A Discord webhook URL only when testing successful application delivery

pnpm is the canonical package manager. Do not create or commit npm, Yarn or Bun lockfiles.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IEESEC/ieesec-website.git
cd ieesec-website
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.19.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

On PowerShell, replace the copy command with `Copy-Item .env.example .env.local`.

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The middleware redirects unprefixed URLs to the default Greek locale.

`DISCORD_JOIN_WEBHOOK_URL` may remain empty for ordinary UI work. A valid secret is required for a successful join-form submission; never commit a real webhook.
